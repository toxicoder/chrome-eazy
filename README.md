# chrome-eazy

**Supercharge your browser workflow by organizing your tabs into clean, distinct workspaces.**

`chrome-eazy` is a Chrome extension for users who juggle multiple projects or contexts. It uses the Side Panel API to create a central hub for managing "workspaces"‚Äîlogical groups of tabs that you can switch between instantly.

## Features

- **‚úÖ Workspace Management:** Create and name workspaces to group your tabs by task, project, or any other category.
- **üöÄ One-Click Switching:** Activate a workspace to instantly bring all its tabs into focus while hiding others.
- **üôà Automatic Tab Hiding:** Inactive workspaces have their tabs neatly tucked away into a collapsed tab group, reducing clutter.
- **‚ûï Easily Add Tabs:** Add the current tab to your active workspace with a single click.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Centralized View:** See all your workspaces and the tabs within the active one, all from the comfort of the Chrome Side Panel.

## Installation

Since the extension is in active development, you'll need to load it manually in Chrome's developer mode.

1.  **Download the Code:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toxicoder/chrome-eazy.git
    ```
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on **Developer mode**.
4.  **Load the Extension:** Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears and select the `chrome-eazy` directory you just downloaded.

The `chrome-eazy` icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar. Clicking it will open the Side Panel.

## How It Works

`chrome-eazy` leverages several modern Chrome Extension APIs to provide a seamless experience:

-   **`chrome.sidePanel`**: This API is used to create the main user interface, which lives in the browser's side panel. The UI is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (`sidebar.html`, `sidebar.css`, `sidebar.js`).
-   **`chrome.storage.local`**: All workspace data, including the list of workspaces and the tabs they contain, is stored in the browser's local storage. This ensures your workspaces persist across browser sessions.
-   **`chrome.tabGroups`**: This is the magic behind showing and hiding tabs. When you switch to a new workspace, the tabs from all other workspaces are grouped together into a single, collapsed group titled "Inactive Workspaces". When you switch back, tabs are ungrouped and restored.
-   **`background.js`**: This is the service worker that runs in the background. It listens for browser events (like a tab closing) to keep the workspace data in sync and handles the core logic of showing and hiding tabs by communicating with the `tabGroups` API.
-   **`sidebar.js`**: This script manages the entire side panel UI. It's responsible for rendering the list of workspaces and tabs, handling user clicks, and communicating with the background script to trigger actions.
